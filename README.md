The Inventory Management Module integrates various IoT technologies such as RFID scanning, environmental monitoring, and space optimization to efficiently manage product inventory. It enables real-time tracking of products, ensures optimal storage conditions, and provides notifications to staff when warehouse capacity is reached. Additionally, users can access inventory data and activity logs through a user-friendly website, with secure device identification using MAC addresses for tracking Raspberry Pi devices.
